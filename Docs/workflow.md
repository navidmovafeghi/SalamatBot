### **The Solo Developer's Professional Software Workflow (v4.0 - Streamlined)**

This document is a reusable template for initiating and developing a software project as a solo developer. It emphasizes a professional, structured approach that includes formal analysis and design in every development cycle to ensure quality, maintainability, and a consistent rhythm from concept to delivery.

---

### **Phase I: Foundation & Setup (The "Sprint Zero")**

**Goal:** Establish a professional, automated development environment and a clear architectural blueprint *before* writing the first feature.

**0.[** ‚úÖ **] PRD**

- **Artifact:** PRD.md
- **Output**:
    
    [PRD ](PRD%2021bd12c0b70b809381dbc3a68fc26795.md)
    

**1. [** ‚úÖ **]  Architectural Baseline**

- **Artifact:** ADD.md (in your Git repo)

**2. [** ‚úÖ **] Finalize Foundational Technology Stack**

- **Action:** Add a "Technology Stack" section to ADD.md.
- **Guideline:** Be deliberate. Choose technologies you know well or have a specific reason to learn.

**3. [** ‚úÖ **] Define Initial Definition of Done (DoD)**

- **Artifact:** DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md (in your Git repo)
- **Action:** Create a minimal, realistic quality checklist that will evolve as you learn.
- **Initial DoD Template:**
    
    ```
    ‚úÖ Code compiles and runs without errors
    ‚úÖ Basic manual testing completed
    ‚úÖ Code committed to version control with clear commit message
    ‚úÖ No obvious bugs or console errors
    ‚úÖ Basic error handling implemented
    ‚úÖ Code follows project naming conventions
    Note: This DoD will evolve as the project matures.
    Last updated: [Date]
    ```
    

**4. [** ‚úÖ **] Risk Assessment & Mitigation Plan**

- **Action:** Document known technical risks and fallback approaches.
- **Artifact:** Add "Risk Assessment" section to ARCHITECTURE.md.

**5. [ ] Environment & Pipeline Setup**

- **Action:** Build the practical infrastructure for development.
- **Checklist:** Source Control, Project Scaffolding, Code Quality Tools, Environment Variables, Developer Experience (DX), Database Setup, Basic CI Pipeline, "Smoke Test" Verification.

**6. [ ] Performance & Security Baseline**

- **Action:** Define basic performance requirements and security standards.
- **Artifact:** Add sections to ARCHITECTURE.md for performance targets and security considerations.

**7. [ ] Create the Initial Product Backlog**

- **Action:** Set up your project board (e.g., GitHub Projects).
- **Checklist:**
    - **Configure Board:** Create columns: Backlog, **Sprint Ready**, **This Sprint**, In Progress, Done.
    - **Configure Labels:** Create labels like Epic, User Story, Bug, Chore, Spike, Technical Debt.
    - **Create Epics:** Create issues for high-level feature sets.
    - **Write Initial Stories:** Create issues for the first few stories with basic user story format (As a... I want... So that...). **Note:** Acceptance Criteria will be added during Backlog Refinement.

---

### **Phase II: Iterative Development (The Sprints)**

**Goal:** Build the application incrementally with a consistent rhythm that formally separates design from implementation, with evolving quality standards.

**The Weekly Rhythm (Example: 1-Week Sprint)**

**Monday: Analysis & Design Day (The "Architect & Analyst Hat")**

- **Morning (1 hour) - Sprint Planning:**
    1. **Declare Sprint Goal:** State a clear, achievable goal. e.g., "This week, I will fully design, build, and test the User Registration feature."
    2. **Select Work:** Move the highest-priority User Story from the Sprint Ready column to the This Sprint column. This is the focus for the week.
- **Afternoon (2-3 hours) - Deep Analysis & Design Session:**
    
    **Goal:** Transform a user story into a complete technical blueprint that makes implementation almost mechanical.
    
    **Pre-Design Setup (10 minutes)**
    
    ```markdown

    - **Implementation Readiness:** Confirm all tasks are clearly defined and dependencies available
    
    **Final Output:** Complete GitHub Issue with all design documentation and implementation checklist
    

**Tuesday - Thursday: Implementation Day(s) (The "Engineer Hat")**

1. **Move the Card:** On your board, move the User Story from This Sprint to In Progress.
2. **Daily Stand-up (5-10 mins):** A quick mental check-in: *What did I complete yesterday? What will I do today? Are there any blockers or new learnings that affect my approach?*
3. **üíª Implementation:**
    - Work through the technical task list from Monday's design session
    - Follow the current DoD standards
    - Commit and push frequently, ensuring any CI pipeline remains green
    - Document any deviations from the original design and reasons why
4. **üìä Mid-Sprint Check (Wednesday - 10 mins):**
    - **Progress Assessment:** Am I on track with Monday's task list?
    - **Scope Review:** Has scope crept in? Do I need to adjust?
    - **Blocker Identification:** Any technical challenges requiring design changes?
    - **Quality Check:** Am I maintaining DoD standards?

**Friday: Review & Reflect Day (The "QA & Process Hat")**

1. **Sprint Review (Demo to Yourself):**
    - **‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria Check:** Does the feature do what it's supposed to do from the user's perspective?
    - **üîç Definition of Done Check:** Was the feature built correctly according to the current DoD?
    - **üîí Security Validation:** Are security requirements met?
    - **‚ö° Performance Check:** Does it meet performance expectations?
    - If all checks pass, close the issue and move the card to Done.
2. **üìä Technical Debt Assessment (15 mins):**
    - **Code Review:** Quick scan for code that needs future refactoring
    - **Documentation:** Are there gaps in documentation?
    - **Testing:** Are there untested edge cases?
    - **Action:** Create technical debt issues for future sprints if needed
3. **üîÑ Sprint Retrospective (15 mins):**
    - **üå± Process Reflection:**
        - What went well this week (in Analysis, Design, Implementation)?
        - What was a bottleneck or challenge?
        - Did the DoD serve me well, or do I need adjustments?
        - What is one small action I can take to improve next week?
    - **üìù Document Learnings:** Update process notes or DoD based on insights

---

### **Phase III: Continuous Refinement**

**Goal:** Maintain momentum, manage technical debt, ensure the project is always ready for the next challenge, and continuously improve quality standards.

**1. Backlog Refinement (The "Look Ahead")**

- **When:** Weekly (e.g., Friday after the Retrospective, or as a dedicated time-block).
- **Action:** Look ahead in your Backlog to stories planned for the next 1-2 sprints.
- **Process:**
    1. **Story Review:** Ensure each story has clear user story format (As a... I want... So that...)
    2. **Acceptance Criteria Creation:** Write specific, testable acceptance criteria using Given-When-Then format
    3. **Story Sizing:** Ensure stories are appropriately sized (can be completed in one sprint)
    4. **Dependency Identification:** Note any dependencies or prerequisites
- **Goal:** Ensure stories are **"Ready for Sprinting"** with complete acceptance criteria
- **Outcome:** Move refined stories from Backlog to Sprint Ready column

**2. Quarterly DoD Evolution Review**

- **When:** End of each Epic or monthly
- **Action:** Comprehensive review of DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md
- **Process:**
    1. **Standards Assessment:** Which DoD items have proven valuable? Which are ignored?
    2. **Technology Maturity:** Have I learned better practices that should be standard?
    3. **Project Phase:** Do quality standards need to increase as the project matures?
    4. **Realistic Calibration:** Remove standards that are unrealistic or not providing value
    5. **New Standards:** Add proven practices that have emerged from recent sprints
- **Outcome:** Updated DoD that reflects current project needs and your skill growth

**3. Architectural Review (The "Architect Hat")**

- **When:** End of major features, or monthly
- **Action:** Re-read and update ARCHITECTURE.md
- **Review Points:**
    - Are architectural decisions still accurate?
    - Do any decisions need revision based on learnings?
    - Are there upcoming refactors needed for technical debt?
    - Do new features require architectural spikes or research?
- **Outcome:** Updated architecture documentation and technical debt backlog

**4. Process Optimization**

- **When:** Monthly or when workflow feels inefficient
- **Action:** Review and refine this workflow document itself
- **Questions:**
    - Are the time allocations realistic?
    - Do any steps consistently get skipped? (Maybe they're not valuable)
    - Are there new practices to incorporate?
    - Is the weekly rhythm sustainable?
